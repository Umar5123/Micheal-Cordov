                <p>Even though you try to avoid accidents, you can be injured because another person wasn’t watching out
                    for your safety. Whether it was a <span>slip-and-fall,</span> a <span>car accident,</span> a
                    <span>medical injury,</span> a product injury, or some other type of accident, you deserve monetary
                    compensation for the injuries and damages someone else has forced upon you.
                </p>
                <p>Filing a <span>personal injury claim or lawsuit in Phoenix</span> is not something the average person
                    can do on
                    their own. There are complex laws that can affect your case, as well as difficult negotiations and
                    paperwork you will have to complete. You must also accurately calculate your losses, investigate the
                    accident, and collect evidence to prove negligence.
                </p>
                <p>You deserve to have the help of a dedicated, meticulous legal professional who can guide you through
                    every step of the Phoenix personal injury claim process. You should be able to focus on recovering
                    from your injuries and getting back to work. That’s why it’s important for you to reach out to a
                    Phoenix injury lawyer at the Law Offices of Michael Cordova.
                </p>
                <p>Don’t delay in calling a lawyer at our office. Most Arizona injury cases require you to submit your
                    claim within two years of the date of your accident. Failure to submit your claim within this time
                    frame will prevent you and your family from receiving the compensation you’re owed.

                            accountable for your suffering. An attorney can investigate the product that caused you harm
                            and do what’s possible to hold the manufacturer legally responsible.
